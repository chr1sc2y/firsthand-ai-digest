# Firsthand AI Digest

**Every 6 hours, the sharpest AI voices in one place.**

A self-hosted digest that automatically aggregates what AI's leading researchers, founders, and builders are saying — across X posts, long-form blogs, podcasts, and YouTube — then publishes it as a clean, interactive site on GitHub Pages.

No login. No algorithm. No noise.

## What it tracks

| Source | What you get |
|--------|-------------|
| **X / Twitter** | Real-time posts from 50+ AI leaders |
| **Blogs** | Long-form writing from OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, and independent researchers |
| **Podcasts** | Episodes featuring leaders you follow, filtered by name |
| **YouTube** | Recent uploads from AI research channels |

## How it works

GitHub Actions fetches from every source on a 6-hour schedule and commits normalized data segments to this repo. GitHub Pages serves the static site — no backend, no database, no cost.

The 6-hour cadence is calibrated to keep [Apify](https://apify.com/) usage inside the free monthly platform credit. Bump the cron frequency in [`.github/workflows/daily.yml`](.github/workflows/daily.yml) if you have your own paid budget.

Flip between time windows (3h · 6h · 12h · 24h · 3d · 7d) to see what's fresh or catch up on the week.
