# Data Sources

What we fetch, where it lives, and how stable it is.

## X / Twitter

- **Provider**: Apify actor [`kaitoeasyapi~twitter-x-data-tweet-scraper-pay-per-result-cheapest`](
  https://apify.com/kaitoeasyapi/twitter-x-data-tweet-scraper-pay-per-result-cheapest)
- **Cost**: ~$0.25 per 1k tweets; each 6-hour run batches all handles into
  one actor call and then clips locally. The 6-hour cadence keeps the
  per-month spend inside Apify's free $5 monthly platform credit.
- **Input mode**: one batched Apify Actor run with `searchTerms[]`, using
  Twitter search syntax like `from:sama since_time:<unix> until_time:<unix>`.
- **Stability**: backed by Apify's rotating proxy pool; survives X's
  anti-scraping changes better than a direct API.
- **Auth**: `apify_token` in `config/secrets.json`.
- **Why not the official X API**: free tier is too restrictive; paid tier
  is $100+/mo for our volume.
- **Why not RapidAPI's twitter154**: that endpoint went dark.

The configured handles live in [`config/sources.json`](../config/sources.json)
under `x_users[]`.

## Blogs

Plain RSS / Atom feeds. Currently:

| Source                | Feed                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| OpenAI                | `https://openai.com/blog/rss.xml`                      |
| Google DeepMind       | `https://deepmind.google/blog/rss.xml`                 |
| Sam Altman            | `https://blog.samaltman.com/posts.atom`                |
| Andrej Karpathy       | `https://karpathy.github.io/feed.xml`                  |
| Simon Willison        | `https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/`           |
| Lilian Weng           | `https://lilianweng.github.io/index.xml`               |
| Import AI (Jack Clark)| `https://jack-clark.net/feed/`                         |

Anthropic's and Meta's blog feeds are intentionally absent — Anthropic's
`/news/rss.xml` and `/engineering/rss.xml` both return 404, and Meta has
no public RSS. Anthropic-side signal is captured via the Anthropic
YouTube channel and `@DarioAmodei` / `@AmandaAskell` / `@_catwu` on X.

## Podcasts

Public RSS feeds, hosted on whatever each show happens to use (Substack,
Megaphone, Libsyn, the host's own server). We do not depend on a single
aggregator (Spotify / Apple) because none of them re-export third-party
shows as RSS.

Episode-level filtering: only keep episodes whose title / summary /
author / keywords match a configured X leader's name or `@handle`. Pass
`--no-podcast-filter` to disable.

```
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC...
```

To find a channel ID: visit the channel page, view source, search for
`"channelId":"UC...`. The current list:

| Channel              | Type                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Lex Fridman          | host                       |
| Dwarkesh Patel       | host                       |
| Two Minute Papers    | research roundup           |
| Yannic Kilcher       | paper deep dives           |
| AI Explained         | analysis                   |
| OpenAI               | first-party (demos, keynotes) |
| Google DeepMind      | first-party (research)     |
| Anthropic            | first-party (research)     |
| Hugging Face         | first-party (tools, models)|

## Frequency / Window defaults

| Category | Cron | Window |
|----------|------|--------|
| X / posts        | every 6 h | exact 6 h segment |
| Blogs            | every 6 h | exact 6 h segment |
| YouTube videos   | every 6 h | exact 6 h segment |
| Podcasts         | every 6 h | exact 6 h segment |

Knobs: `--hours`, `--blog-hours`, `--video-hours`, `--podcast-hours`.

The 6-hour cadence is chosen so that the monthly Apify spend stays inside
the free $5 platform credit (≈ 20k tweets / month).
